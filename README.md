# nil
A small package for nillable types.

Package nilable is an easy way to easily use Go types while still
distinguishing between an absent value and a zero-type.

This distinction (absent versus zero) can occur in APIs that unmarshal
a JSON payload into a specific type. If the payload does not set specific
JSON fields, the Go type it's marshaled into will set the unspecified fields
to their zero values.

This is remedied in one of two ways:

First, the API could use "replace" semantics instead of "edit." This means
the object or data sent through the API is replacing what it represents on
the server. In practical terms, this could be represented by first getting
the entire object from the server, modifying the necessary fields, and then
sending the entire object back.

While this works, it requires two round-trips to the server and could allow
for race conditions, depending how the API is structured.

The second remedy is to use something similar to this package: nilable values.
Nilable values would solve the previous problem by creating a distinction
between absent and zero. This means instead of two round-trips to the server,
the client would only have to send one request containing the modified fields.

All basic types in package nilable implement the Nilable interface.

The basic structure of a nilable type is a struct containing a pointer to the
native type.

For example:

		type String struct {
			s *string
		}

Each type has a method which returns the underlying type. By convention,
this method is the name of the Nilable type, which is also the exported
version of the name of the underlying type.

		int64 -> Int64
		string -> String
		bool -> Bool

Each type has a String method which returns the canonical string version
of the type. (As it would normally be printed using the "%s" verb.)
One caveat is nil -- if the type is nil, "<nil>" will be returned.

Each type should be passed by value like a normal Go type. (I.e., do not
pass around *T.)
